Test Cases, Suites and Tags
===========================

.. _test-cases:

Test Cases
----------

A **Test Case** is a named set of steps for testing a single feature or
characteristic of the system under test. Test cases are associated with a
:ref:`product <products>`, and can have one version per :ref:`product
version<product-versions>`. They can be organized via :ref:`suites
<test-suites>` and/or :ref:`tags<tags>`, and can have file
:ref:`attachments<attachments>`. Preconditions, assumptions, and other
preliminary information can be provided in the case's *description*. A test
case can have any number of steps; each step has an *instruction* and an
*expected result*.

.. _test-case-edit-fields:

Case Edit Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Product** - The product that owns this test case.
* **Version** - The product version of this test case.
* **And Later Versions** - Create a test case version for the specified Product
  Version as well as a case version for each later Product Version.  (e.g.: if
  Product Versions 3, 4 and 5 exist for this Product, and you have specified
  Product Version 4, this case will be created for versions 4 and 5)
* **Suite** - (optional) The existing suite to which you want this case to
  belong.
  You can also add cases to suites later.
* **ID Prefix** - (optional) A string that will be displayed as part of the
  case ID.  This can be a component name, or any string that is pertinent.
  This is also supported when filtering by ID.  You can filter by the prefix
  only, by the ID, or by the prefix-ID combination.
* **Name** - The summary name for the case.
* **Description** - Any description, pre-conditions, links or notes to
  associate with the case.  This field is displayed while running the test.
  Markdown_ syntax is supported.
* **Priority** - The priority of the test case.  Set a case as ``priority 1``
  to indicate it is the highest priority.  This can be anywhere from no
  priority, or from 1 through 4.  This is the same across all versions of the
  case.  You can filter and sort by this field when running or managing
  cases.  You can also filter by this when selecting which cases to include
  in a suite.
* **Add Tags** - Enter tags to apply to this case.  Hit enter after each tag to
  see the tag chicklet displayed.  Auto-completes for existing tags.  During
  test execution, cases that have tags will show the tag descriptions with
  with each case.
* **Add Attachment** - You can attach files to cases that may help running the
  test.  (e.g: images, audio, video, etc.)
* **Instruction / Expected** - The test instruction and corresponding expected
  result.  You can choose to put all instructions / expectations in one step,
  or break them down to individual steps.  When running the test, you will have
  the option to fail on specific steps, so you may find this a better approach.
  Markdown syntax is supported.
* **Save** - You can choose to save the case as draft or active.  Only active
  cases can be run in a test run.

.. _test-suites:

Test Suites
-----------

A **Test Suite** is a named collection of test cases that can be included in a
:ref:`test run<test-runs>`.

.. _test-suite-edit-fields:

Suite Edit Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Product** - The product that owns this test case.
* **Name** - The name of the suite.
* **Description** - Any description for the suite.
* **Available Cases** - Test Cases that have the same Product you selected for this
  suite.  This list is filterable.
* **Included Cases** - Test Cases that are included in the Suite.  This list is not
  filtered.

.. _tags:

Tags
----

A **Tag** can be associated with one or more :ref:`test cases<test-cases>` as a
way to organize and filter them on any number of axes.

By default, tags are :ref:`product<products>`-specific; global tags can also be
created and managed via the tag management UI.

Merging Tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _tag-merge:

The edit screen for tags is a great way to merge two tags into one.  For
example, if you wanted to merge TagA and TagB all into TagB, then simply:

* Edit TagB
* In the list of available cases, filter on TagA
* Select all the available cases and click the green add button
* Save TagB
* Delete TagA


.. _tag-edit-fields:

Tag Edit Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Name** - The name of the tag.
* **Product** - (optional) Tags can be specific to a Product, or they can be
  global.  If a tag is Product specific, then cases for other products can't
  use it.  This is useful if you want to separate tags for different products.
* **Description** - (optional) This description will be displayed during test
  execution before the test case description and steps.  This is useful to
  provide some *setup* or *precondition* code that doesn't have to be
  repeated for a group of cases.  Supports Markdown_ syntax.
* **Available Cases** - Test Cases that have the same Product you selected for
  this tag.  This list is filterable.
* **Included Cases** - Test Cases that have this tag applied.  This list is not
  filtered.


.. _attachments:

Attachments
-----------

A :ref:`test case<test-cases>` can have any number of file attachments: these
will be made available for download by testers when the test case is executed.
